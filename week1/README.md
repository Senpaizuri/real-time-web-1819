## About this project 

This app is a multi-user drawing grid. Here you can draw and "Login" to create some pixel art together.

The app provides the topics, you have a 60s window to create the pixelart!

## Dependencies used to run this app

- Node.js
- Express
- Socket.io
- EJS
- Gulp.js (tooling)

## Api
[**Roger's random object generator**](http://roger.redevised.com/)
This api generates random object without the obsecure words.

>## Why?
>If your application needs a random object, you probably don't want obscure words (e.g. enfilade) or things that are not even objects.
>## Everyday Items
>Roger gives you everyday items, things that have form and function.

## Data

This app uses roughly 2 types of data,
1. *API* data
2. *USER* generated data

### API
The api data in itself is minimal, but it has no other need then to supply the subject for the drawings.

### USER
The user generated data is a bit more complex.
The user is "logged" in by signing up with a user name.
Afterwards the user can draw when there are at least **2** people present.
You can draw on the grid by simply clicking or draging.
Each pixel that is updated is send to the server and send back to the other users in real time.

After a 60s interval, a snapshot is created on the client and "saved". The canvas is then cleared and a new topic is supplied.

## Wishlist

- [x] Better support for user input changes
- [x] Better draw support
- [x] Clientside Snapshots
- [ ] Mobile touch support
- [ ] Serverside data presistance
- [ ] Serverside Snapshots
- [ ] Proper save mechanism
