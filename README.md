## Installing the app

The app already runs [here](letsdrawstuff.herokuapp.com).
However if you want to run the build locally you can run:
```bash
    # Install packages
    $ npm i
```
```bash
    # Run Gulp to build file changes
    $ gulp watch
```
```bash
    # Boot the server
    $ nodemon server.js
        or
    $ npm start
```
